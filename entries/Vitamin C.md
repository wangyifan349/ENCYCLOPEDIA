# Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) — Detailed Antioxidant Profile

## 1. Molecular Structure & Properties  
- Chemical Name: Ascorbic Acid  
- Formula: C6H8O6  
- Molecular Weight: 176.12 g/mol  
- Structure: Five-membered lactone ring + two adjacent enediol hydroxyl groups (–OH)  
- Solubility: Highly water-soluble; unstable in neutral/alkaline pH, light, heat, and metal ions  
- Acid Dissociation Constants:  
  • pKa1 ≈ 4.1 (first –OH)  
  • pKa2 ≈ 11.6 (second –OH)

## 2. Redox Chemistry  
- Ascorbic acid can donate two electrons and two protons to become dehydroascorbic acid (DHA).  
- Standard redox potential (E₀′ at pH 7): +0.08 V (good reducing agent under physiological conditions)

Key half-reaction (non-Markdown format):  
  C6H8O6 → C6H6O6 + 2 H⁺ + 2 e⁻  
  C6H6O6 + 2 H⁺ + 2 e⁻ → C6H8O6  

## 3. Main Antioxidant Reactions  
1. **Free Radical Scavenging**  
   - With hydroxyl radicals (·OH):  
     AscH⁻ + ·OH → Asc·⁻ + H2O  
   - With superoxide anion (O2·⁻):  
     AscH⁻ + O2·⁻ → Asc·⁻ + H2O2  

2. **Regeneration of Other Antioxidants**  
   - Reduces vitamin E radical (Toc·) back to active form (TocH):  
     AscH⁻ + Toc· → Asc·⁻ + TocH  

3. **Metal Ion Chelation**  
   - Binds Fe³⁺/Cu²⁺, reducing Fenton reaction that produces ·OH:  
     AscH⁻ + Fe³⁺ → [Asc–Fe³⁺] → DHA–Fe³⁺  

4. **Support of Antioxidant Enzymes**  
   - Maintains activity of enzymes like glutathione peroxidase (GPx)

## 4. Chemical Stability & Degradation  
- **pH Sensitivity**: Stable at pH 3–4; oxidizes above pH 6  
- **Light & Heat**: Accelerates oxidation, yellow/brown discoloration  
- **Metal Catalysis**: Fe³⁺ and Cu²⁺ accelerate conversion to DHA and polymeric byproducts  
- **Lactone Ring Opening**: Irreversible degradation under strong acid/base or high temperature

## 5. Biological Functions & Health Benefits  
- **Cell Protection**: Prevents oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, lipids  
- **Immune Support**: Enhances neutrophil and macrophage function; moderates inflammation  
- **Collagen Synthesis**: Cofactor for prolyl/lysyl hydroxylases, essential for skin, blood vessels, bone  
- **Cardiovascular Health**: Inhibits oxidation of LDL cholesterol  
- **Iron Absorption**: Reduces Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺, improving intestinal uptake of non-heme iron

## 6. Dietary Intake & Supplementation  
- **Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA)**:  
  • Adult men: 90 mg/day  
  • Adult women: 75 mg/day  
  • Smokers: +35 mg/day  
- **Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)**: 2000 mg/day  
- **Sources**: Citrus fruits, berries, kiwi, bell peppers, broccoli, spinach  
- **Supplement Tips**:  
  • Split doses (<200 mg each) for better absorption  
  • Take with meals to reduce stomach upset  
  • Avoid co-administration with iron supplements (separate by ≥2 hours)

## 7. Storage Recommendations  
- Store in airtight, light-proof containers  
- Keep at 2–8 °C if in solution or open to air  
- Prepare solutions fresh in mildly acidic buffer (pH 3–4)
